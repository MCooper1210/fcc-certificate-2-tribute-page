This repository contains the index.html and styles.css for the second freeCodeCamp course certificate, a tribute page. For this, I chose one of my favourite characters from the Warhammer 40k universe, Alpharius.

## Description

The index.html utilises skills from previous sections of the course, and builds upon this by including elements such as lists, images and hyperlinks. 

The main aspect of this project is the application of CSS. In this I have learnt to provide a consistent theme through background, text and colour styling, adding padding and borders for improved page organisation, using Flexbox layout and styling images.

The finished webpage serves as an introduction to my favourite character, Primarch Alpharius Omegon, of the XXth Legion. Along with a list of other Primarchs from the setting. This includes artwork of Alpharius leading a group of Alpha Legionnaires, a list of other Primarchs, a notable quote from the character, and a link to a wiki for the other Primarchs.
